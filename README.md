# Alliant Technologies Achievment Record
List of completed or in progress tasks at Alliant Technologies. This is for me to record what I am doing and what I already did so I can vouch for myself when performance review time comes.

| Week | Tasks | Description | Progress |
| -- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| 5/6 - 5/10 | Setup Azure repository, completed programming challenge 1 | Setup the azure repository, pushed to main, made changes and submitted pull requests, modified code based on comments, merged changes into main | Complete |

| | C/C# emulator project analysys | Performed analysis of EmulatorView project and found locations of an issue where memory addresses were being sent in a shared memory buffer occured. | Complete |
| | Solution proposal | Propose potential solutions for this problem and provide a best recommendation. | Complete |
| 5/13 - 5/17 | Solution proposal | Studied the source code for the C portion of emulator view and updated previously suggested solutions. Arrived at solution: Keep addresses in an array and send the index to EmulatorView as its unique ID instead of a pointer. Further solution would be to simply send the conveyor states instead of both index and state. This would be the optimized solution to save memory. | Complete |
